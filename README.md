# gym-chrono

Gym Chrono is a set of continuous state and action spaces DRL environmentbased on the open-source physics engine [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/). 
In order to run these environment you need to install [PyChrono](https://projectchrono.org/pychrono/). 
Being part of Project Chrono, PyChrono is **free and open-source**. Moreover, it provides an [Anaconda installer](https://anaconda.org/projectchrono/pychrono).
Currently, these tasks are supported:

**chrono_pendulum-v0** 


![](http://projectchrono.org/assets/manual/Tutorial_tensorflow_pendulum.jpg)

Reverse pendulum, the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.  1 action (force along the z axis) and 4 observations (position and speed of cart and pole).

**chrono_ant-v0** 


![](http://projectchrono.org/assets/manual/Tutorial_tensorflow_ant.jpg)

A 4-legged walker, the goal is learning to walk straight as fast as possible. 8 actions (motor torques) and 30 observations (GOG height, COG speed, COG orientation in Euler Angles, COG rotational speed, joints rotation, joints speed, feet contact).

**chrono_hexapod-v0** 


![](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono-web-assets/blob/master/Images/Hexapod.jpg)

A 6-legged walker, the goal is learning to walk straight as fast as possible. Heach legs counts 3 actuated joints.
18 actions (motor torques) and 53 observations (GOG height, COG speed, COG orientation in Euler Angles, COG rotational speed, joints rotation, joints speed, feet contact).

This is a model of a real hexapod robot, the PhantomX Hexapod Mark II. Motors dara are available [here](https://trossenrobotics.com/dynamixel-ax-12-robot-actuator.aspx). Credit to [Hendricks](https://grabcad.com/hendricks-1) for the CAD drawings.

**ChronoRacer3Reach-v0** 


![](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono-web-assets/blob/master/Images/Comau.jpg)

A 6-DOF robotic arm (Comau Racer-3), the goal is minimizing the distance between the center of the gripper and the center of the red target box. CAD files and part of the techical data are freely available from the Comau website [here](https://www.comau.com/IT/le-nostre-competenze/robotics/robot-team/racer-3-063) .
6 actions (motor torques) and 18 observations (joints rotation, joints speed, end-effector position, target position).

# Installation
If you want to install Gym and Chrono in a virtual environment (Conda or VirtualEnv), don't forget to activate the environment first.
### 1. Clone gym-chrono
```
git clone https://github.com/projectchrono/gym-chrono.git
```

### 2. Anaconda Environment Setup
2.1 Move into the repository.
```
cd gym-chrono
```

2.1 Checkout the branch with the .yml.
```
git checkout tutorial_solution
```

2.2A. Use the .yml to create a new conda environment with the necessary packages.
```
conda env create -f conda_env_magic_tutorial.yml
```

2.2B. Alternatively, follow these instructions:
```
conda create -n conda_env_magic_tutorial python=3.7
conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu=1.14 --yes
pip install gym
# if Linux
conda install mpi4py --yes
conda install -c projectchrono/label/develop pychrono --yes
# You will get an error because MuJoCo can't be installed. This is harmless.
pip install baselines
```

2.3. Confirm the new environment exists on your system. It should be called "magic_tutorial".
```
conda env list
```
2.4. Activate the new environment.
```
conda activate magic_tutorial
```
### 4. Tutorial
```
python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=gym_chrono.envs:chrono_double_pendulum-v0 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=2e7 --ent_coef=0.1 --num_hidden=32 --num_layers=3 --value_network=copy
```


### 3. Example
Training the ant environment using the PPOalgorithm in [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
```bash
python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=gym_chrono.envs:chrono_ant-v0 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=2e7 --ent_coef=0.1 --num_hidden=32 --num_layers=3 --value_network=copy
```

### Gym and Chrono
To install Chrono follow [these](http://api.projectchrono.org/development/pychrono_installation.html) instructions. 
Install Gym. Obviously, OpenAI Gym is a prerequisite for gym-chrono. 
```bash
pip install gym
```
Then, install the PyChrono extension for Gym:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectchrono/gym-chrono/
cd gym-chrono
pip install -e .
```
